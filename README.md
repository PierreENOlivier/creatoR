## Overview

A package to create image-based content for social media platforms such as instagram (for now). It can handle single images as well as carousel slides. The package takes a content configuration file (e.g. theme, logos, usertags, content of each slide) stored as JSON and process it to implement the multiple layers of the final image, in a similar spirit as ggplot2.
